# My notes from the 2023 Beginner Boost


Headings begin with octothorpes (#). Include a blank line after the heading to separate from following paragraph.

```md
# Heading 1

Paragraph

## Heading 2

```
This is the body of the zettel (which means "slip")

* First bullet
* Second bullet

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
2. Second

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
```

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***

How about something that looks like `code`?

And when I hae a URL I want it to print also so I always write it out like this:

https://rwx.gg

* I put references at the bottom
