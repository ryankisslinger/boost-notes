# My notes from the 2023 Beginner Boost

Headings begin with octothorpes (#). Include a blank line after the heading to separate from following paragraph.

```md
# Heading 1

Paragraph

## Heading 2

```

## Formatting

Just use stars.

* Use *one star* for italic (em).
* Use **two stars** for bold (strong).
* Use ***three stars*** for bold/italic (strong em).
* This is `monospace` stuff (pre, code).
* Use dollar signs for inline math $\sqrt{3x-1}+{1+x}^2$

* First bullet
* Second bullet

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
```

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***

How about something that looks like `code`?
